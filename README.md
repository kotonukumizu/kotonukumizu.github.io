# Global Music Chart Analysis

This project analyzes how Japanese popular music is received across different countries
using international music chart data.

## Why this matters
Global music platforms need to understand regional listening behavior,
cultural proximity, and catalog rediscovery.
This project simulates product-level music analytics for streaming services.

## Data
- Weekly Top 100 music charts across multiple countries
- Focus on Japanese popular music
- Enriched with release year, genre, and music metadata

## Key Findings
- Strong chart similarity between culturally and linguistically close countries
- Around 30% of internationally popular tracks are catalog titles (5+ years old)
- Genre and instrumental characteristics vary significantly by country

## Methods
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Rank-based correlation analysis
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Repository Structure
- `/notebooks`: Analysis notebooks
- `/data`: Sample datasets (anonymized and reduced)

## What I would explore next
- Integrating streaming-level user signals
- Modeling UGC-driven rediscovery
- Market-specific recommendation strategies
